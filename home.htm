        <h1> Introduction </h1>
        <p> Wisconsin Hops is an Open Ultimate Frisbee Team primarily based out of Stevens Point Wisconsin, but members travel from all parts of the state. Founded in 2005, Hops ran for a 4 years before being disbanded. Hops then reemerged when Tom Hoeft wrangled together some of the best players across the state. Hops strive to create a positive ultimate culture in central Wisconsin for all elite players to participate in.
        </p>
        <p>Hops seeks to be a high level team that competes with regional qualifying teams in the midwest. The team seeks to reach that goal by practicing weekly at the UW-Steven's point Track and Field during the summer months. During off-season, members are encouraged to maintain shape and endurance so that early season success can be accomplished the following year.
        </p>
        <p>The team consists of highschool, college, and post-graduate players and welcomes all who want to join and play ultimate at the next level. Additionally, we are always looking for practice players if you are not fully sure you want to play tournaments <br>
